First we need to install the StorageOS Operator using the following yaml manifest.

`kubectl create -f https://github.com/storageos/cluster-operator/releases/download/v2.1.0/storageos-operator.yaml && kubectl -n storageos-operator get pod -w`{{execute}}

> The READY 1/1 indicates that `storageoscluster` resources can be created. Press `Ctrl+C` to continue once the pod is up.

Create a Secret defining the StorageOS credentials. The username and password are just `storageos` encoded in base64.

```
kubectl create -f- <<END
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: "storageos-api"
  namespace: "storageos-operator"
  labels:
    app: "storageos"
type: "kubernetes.io/storageos"
data:
  # echo -n '<secret>' | base64
  apiUsername: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  apiPassword: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  # CSI Credentials
  csiProvisionUsername: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  csiProvisionPassword: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  csiControllerPublishUsername: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  csiControllerPublishPassword: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  csiNodePublishUsername: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  csiNodePublishPassword: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  csiControllerExpandUsername: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  csiControllerExpandPassword: c3RvcmFnZW9z
END
```{{execute}}

This Secret is referenced from the StorageOS Cluster Resource below and will be used
to create an admin user in StorageOS during the bootstrap process. The secret also defines the CSI
credentials that are used during StorageOS and Kubernetes communication.

StorageOS Installation.

The following resource defines the StorageOS Cluster. Many options are available
for configuration. For instance, note the `.spec.kvBackend.address` that indicates
the etcd url, or the `.spec.namespace` that indicates which Kubernetes namespace StorageOS will be
installed into. Other options could be configured such as `nodeSelectors` to
indicate that the StorageOS Daemonset should run on a subset of nodes.

```
kubectl create -f- <<END
apiVersion: "storageos.com/v1"
kind: StorageOSCluster
metadata:
  name: "my-storageos-cluster"
  namespace: "storageos-operator"
spec:
  secretRefName: "storageos-api" # Reference from the Secret created in the previous step
  secretRefNamespace: "storageos-operator"  # Namespace of the Secret
  namespace: "kube-system"
  k8sDistro: "upstream"
  images:
    nodeContainer: "storageos/node:v2.1.0" # StorageOS version

  csi:
    enable: true
    deploymentStrategy: deployment
    enableControllerPublishCreds: true
    enableNodePublishCreds: true
    enableProvisionCreds: true
    enableControllerExpandCreds: true
  resources:
    requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
#  nodeSelectorTerms:
#    - matchExpressions:
#      - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/worker" # Compute node label will vary according to your installation
#        operator: In
#        values:
#        - "true"
END
```{{execute}}

> For additional information on the configuration options exposed by the StorageOSCluster resource, see: https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/cluster-operator/configuration/


Verify StorageOS Installation.

`kubectl -n kube-system get pods -lapp=storageos -w`{{execute}}

> The above command watches the pods created by the StorageOSCluster resource.
> Note that pods typically take approximately 40 seconds to enter the Running
> Phase. Press `Ctrl+C` to continue once the pods are up.

Once the pods are all in the Running state the installation is complete! You have created a StorageOS cluster.

As shown by the `get pods` command above, a StorageOS cluster is comprised of 3 components; the storageos-daemonset, the
csi-helper and the storageos-scheduler.

You can see more information about the StorageOS Cluster using the command below.

`kubectl -n storageos-operator describe storageoscluster my-storageos-cluster`{{execute}}

We also have self-evaluation guide that clearly explains how to install, benchmark and feature test StorageOS in your own cluster: https://docs.storageos.com/docs/self-eval/
